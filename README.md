# Data Lake hosted on S3 using Spark
### Project Overview
###### A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.
###### This project focuses on building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, process data in spark and load load back to S3 as parquet files for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. 


### Project Description
###### In this project,  ETL pipeline is built for processing data in Spark in data lake hosted on S3 data modeling using PySpark programs. load data from S3, process the data into analytics tables using Spark, and load them back into S3 as parquet files.

### Song Dataset
###### The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.
*song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json*
*song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json*
###### And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.
*{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}*
### Log Dataset
###### The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.
###### The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset
*log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json*
*log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json*
###### And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
###### Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables
###### Fact Table
* songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
      * songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
###### Dimension Tables
* users - users in the app
      * user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
* user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
      song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
* artists - artists in music database
      * artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
* time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
      start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

### Project repository details
###### In addition to the data files, the project includes three files:
1. etl.py reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3
2. dl.cfg contains your AWS credentials
3. README.md provides discussion on your process and decisions
      
### ETL Process (pipeline)
###### etl.py reads data from S3, processes that data using Spark, and writes them back to S3 as parquet files.  etl.py performs the major processing by reading json input file, extracts the information for further processing using Spark and converts into required format and write them back to S3 as parquet files.

### Project execution
###### Run etl.py which takes the input file path and reads the json files and converts into required format using Spark and writes them back to S3 as parquet files.
